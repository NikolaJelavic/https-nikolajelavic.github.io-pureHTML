      within city limits. <br />
      One of Germany's sixteen constituent states, Berlin is surrounded by the
      State of Brandenburg and contiguous with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam">Potsdam</a>, Brandenburg's
      capital.<br />

      is Germany's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and

      Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a
      tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. <br />
      Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the
      western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme,
      the largest of which is Lake MÃ¼ggelsee.<br />
      Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a
      temperate seasonal climate. <br />
